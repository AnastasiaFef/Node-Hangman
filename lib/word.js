var Letter = require("./Letter");

// The Word constructor is responsible for creating an array of Letter objects and determining if the user guessed every Letter correctly

  // word.split - splits word into array of letters
  //     .map - instantiate a new `Letter` for each character and return an array
  //            referred to with the instance variable, `letters`
 

// prototypes are optional, but will take up less memory than if we defined
//   each method in the constructor as an instance method

// setting the method on the prototype means all instances of Word share this code
//    but when it is called, `this` refers to that particular instance

// iterate over each letter
// return the solution for each to form an array of solved letters
// create a string from the array of solved letters


// setting `toString()` as a method lets us concatenate it like we would a string!

  // Checks to see if any of the letters in the array match the user's guess and updates `foundLetter`

  // Print the word guessed so far--because we set the method for toString,
  //  JavaScript will automatically concatenate this even if we don't call toString

  // return whether we found a letter
 
// Returns true if all letters in the word have been guessed

  // The `every` method returns true if the callback function returns true for every element in the array
